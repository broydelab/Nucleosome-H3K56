## Files included
The 5 Âµs MD simulation trajectories for the lesion-containing NCP with acetylated K56 (Lesion-H3K56ac-NCP) and an unacetylated K56 in lesion-free NCP (H3K56-NCP) are deposited.

## Note
* Lesion: a well-repaired cis-B[a]P-dG adduct and incorporated it at the position BP 9 from the DNA ends (SHL = 6.25).

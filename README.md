## Files included
The 5 µs MD simulation trajectories for the lesion-containing NCP with acetylated K56 (Lesion-H3K56ac NCP) and an unacetylated K56 in lesion-free NCP (H3K56 NCP) are deposited.
For each system, the trajectory files are presented in binary NETCDF format, *.nc; 
a corresponding topology PRMTOP files, *.top, and the coordinates of the initial structure in PDB files, *.pdb
are also provided. * = Lesion-H3K56ac,H3K56

## Note 
* Lesion: a well-repaired cis-B[a]P-dG adduct.
* Water molecules and ions are not included in all files. 
* The trajectories were saved every 20 ns; trajectories between 0 to 2.5 µs are saved in *1.nc and 
between 2.5 to 5.0 µs are saved in *2.nc for each system.
